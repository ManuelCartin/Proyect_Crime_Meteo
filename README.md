# Proyect_Crime_Meteo
First proyect for my portfolio
This project was created to apply my knowledge of data science from my university degree and the application for the IBM Data Science Certificate. I didn't want it to be a typical project involving downloading data frames from platforms like Kaggle and similar.
So I created the data frame from the San Jose Meteorological History website, along with the OIJ statistics. The latter was downloaded from the entire country and had to be filtered only for San Jose. It was also decided to use only buildings to see if a relationship between climate variables and crime rates in Costa Rica was possible in a San Jose sample.
**This project is not finished due to time constraints between my university studies, the completion of the IBM certificate, and the English course. It had to be applied in days. However, the overslamping area and testing of other ML algorithms must be completed.**
