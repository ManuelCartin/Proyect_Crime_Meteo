# Weather_Crime_Project
# Introduction

This project was born from my interest in approaching problems in an unconventional way and exploring the full lifecycle of AI product development. The idea was to create a slightly unconventional crime prediction model, combining criminal activity data with weather variables.
From the beginning, the main challenge wasn't the model itself, but rather data engineering. I had to test and unify five crime statistics datasets and five historical meteorology datasets. There was no tutorial for this project, which forced me to solve cleaning, joining, and class imbalance problems independently.
My first hypothesis resulted in an initial model with an accuracy of 34%. Through techniques such as SMOTE and Random Oversampling, I managed to increase it to 79%, a significant improvement that demonstrated the importance of data manipulation.
Currently, Version 2 is focused on improving the model's insight and incorporating more categorical variables, as part of my professional growth to optimize the solution.

# Version 1.0
This first version represents the proof of concept. Despite the dataset being limited to the years 2020–2025 and technical challenges such as class imbalance, the model managed to validate the initial hypothesis with 79% accuracy.

# Techniques applied in v1.0
Random Oversampling and SMOTE → applied to reduce the bias generated by class imbalance.
Redefinition of labels using a violence index → ​​Instead of treating each crime as an independent class, I grouped sub-crimes under a violence index. This reduced noise in the data and improved pattern detection.
Result: The combination of balancing techniques with the new definition of variables was key to scaling from 34% to 79% accuracy.

# Version 2.0 (In progress)
The second iteration expands the project's boundaries and consolidates what was learned in the initial version:
Expansion of the data time range: 2015–2025.
Inclusion of new categorical variables related to crime and climate.
Optimization of the violence index to enrich the classification.
Greater focus on the model's explainability and its perception in real-life settings.

# Lessons learned
Applying oversampling techniques is not enough; the key is to rethink the labels and variables.
Designing a violence index was the true differentiator of the model.
Data engineering represents at least half the effort in an AI project.
