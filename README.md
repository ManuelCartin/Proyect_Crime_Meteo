# Weather_Crime_Project
This is my first real data project. It was created to apply my data science knowledge acquired during my university studies and to apply for the IBM Data Science Certificate.
It was born from a conversation with my father, the head of the research department. His theory was that climate affects crime in the country.
Due to limited information, I only obtained the data from official OIJ (National Institute of Statistics and Census) websites and one from French Meteorology.
So I created the data frame from the San José Meteorological History website, along with OIJ statistics. The latter were downloaded from the entire country and had to be filtered only for San José. It was also decided to use only buildings to see if a relationship between climate variables and crime rates in Costa Rica was possible in a San José sample.
Considerations: The limited information requires a broader distribution of crimes and the creation of a violence index target. Balancing techniques and Generative AI are also tested to create a balanced data set.
